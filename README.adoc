BEC - BitEtherCoin
==================

BEC (BitEtherCoin) is an Ethereum Classic coin, issued per each block as a reward to the miner.


It follows Bitcoin's coin Supply Model, with:

* 21M BEC coins total
* 0.00000001 BEC = 1 BECsatoshi
* Halving each new era
* 7th era (99.2% coins) ends at about 2034 (for BTC it's 2036)
* 13th era (99.99% coins) ends at 2048 (for BTC it's 2060)

Specific details:

* mining starts at block 2,726,892
* Era size is 5250000 Ethereum blocks
* starts with 2 BEC reward per ETC block (instead of 50, because Ethereum block time is much smaller)

To claim block reward there should be a special transaction in the block, which calls contract method `claim()`. This
 transaction could be sent from any address, but only an actual miner for current block will receive reward tokens.
